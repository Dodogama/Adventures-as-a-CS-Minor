# AnagramSolver

[link](AnagramSolver.java) runs an algorithm to find single and multi-word anagrams of text files in the terminal. See inputs and outputs folders for examples and their expected outputs.

## Methodology

Note: I likely would have implemented this differently if I double checked the requirement which distinguishes 
permutations of multi-word anagrams (e.g. raze rib != rib raze). I had to add these permutations back
to my output later on by adding an additional recursive call to permute all multi-word anagrams prior to adding
them to my output which heavily increases runtime.

AnagramSolver works by creating a subset of dictionary words which use characters in the given input. This is 
generated by making every permutation of every combination of the input characters and matching those with the
[link](dictionary.txt) file. SearchPrefix() in [link](TrieSTNew.java) was used to prune the recursive tree. 
Anagrams are found by searching for combinations with character lengths equal to the input string. Combinations
and the input string are sorted by character and compared. Matches are stored as anagrams.
